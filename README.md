MSIS822 Project

Arabic AI-Generated Text Detection Using Stylometric Features

Project Overview

This project investigates the detection of AI-generated Arabic academic abstracts using stylometric features and traditional machine learning models.
Instead of relying on large neural language models, the study focuses on interpretable linguistic indicators such as vocabulary richness and entity usage patterns.

The main objective is to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated Arabic texts while maintaining transparency, efficiency, and reproducibility.
